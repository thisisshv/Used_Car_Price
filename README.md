# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a Used Car Price Prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on various features and characteristics.

## Repository Structure
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
- `df1.ipynb`, `df2.ipynb`, `df3.ipynb`: Additional Jupyter Notebooks, containing data preprocessing or exploratory data analysis steps for three different datasets
- `Used Car Price Prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the core analysis, EDA and model development
- `cars-success.gif`: An animated GIF, showing project results success

## Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebooks using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (list to be added based on project dependencies)

## Usage
1. Open the `Used Car Price Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
2. Additional notebooks (`df1.ipynb`, `df2.ipynb`, `df3.ipynb`) containing supplementary analyses or data processing steps.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the analysis and prediction model.
